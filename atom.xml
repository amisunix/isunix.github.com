    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I issue the command “rake new_post[]” using the zsh, I got the error telling me that “no matches found”. I googled, it said if using “noglob rake” rather than simply “rake”, this problem will be solved. But in my case, it does not work. </p>

<p>My expedient solution here is, issuing the followng command:   </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">rake "new_post[on the error using rake new_post under zsh]"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>rather than in the normal way:   </p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">rake new_post["on the error using rake new_post under zsh"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>It works in my case, but it is not a nice solution for sure.</p>

    <id>http://isunix.github.io/blog/2014/05/31/something-about-intermediate-perl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know the language of Perl in late 2011 or early 2012 when I graduated from colleage. I used to spend a lot of time on it when I was in the first company I joined, since that company uses a lot of Perl to do system administratiion. The problem is I have not used perl to write any useful scripts, although I have crafted some small snipptes.   </p>

<p>I always think Perl is not a beautiful language. I know something about Python also, I have spent quite a while to learn Ruby and currently I am using PHP to write some internal tools for my team. I have no idea why deep down in my heart I want to write something useful in Perl. Maybe because it is hard(Kennedy, haha).!!!</p>

<p>I choose the book “intermediate Perl” here, because it is the first book on Perl that I bought. I did not buy learning Perl first because I thought I can grasp the basic of Perl just by reading the ebook and there is no need to buy the elementary one. The fact is I bought “learning Perl” several months later. I read “intermediate Perl” several times, but I can not claim that I can understand it all, actually if I grasp the contents in that book, now it will not be necessary for me to write this post any more. So this post will be the start of a series of topics releated to Perl. Of course I will open another series to write some of the skills that may be useful for a new comer to Perl. I will translate this book into Chinese only for my own study.    </p>

<p>That is it, let us embark on a new journey!  </p>

<p>Previously I was using the name “shpeacelover” which you can google about it.   </p>

<p>However I have not written much useful things under that name. </p>

<p>I hope since now on, I can be more focused on programming and technical things and write more delicately.   </p>

<p>Wish you all have a good time while visiting my dream land!</p>
