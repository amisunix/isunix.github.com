    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You see things, and you say why, but I dream things that never were, and I say why not.  </p>

<p>–Bernard Shaw  </p>

<p>To copy other is necessary，but to copy oneself is pathetic.   </p>

<p>–Pablo Picasso   </p>

<p>It’s nice to be there fighting, trying to go to the limit, bring your body to the limit of his chances,” Nadal said. “Something I really enjoy, and I always said is good to enjoy suffering, no?  So when you are fit, with passion for the game, when you are ready to compete, you are able to suffer and enjoy suffering.  So today I had this feeling, and is a really good one.  I suffered during the match, but I enjoyed all the troubles that I had during the match.  I tried to be there, to find solutions all the time.  I played a lot with my heart.  I played a lot with my mind, and is something that is nice to be around and not just play tennis.   </p>

<p>–Nadal</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my foreword published on this site using the new name “isunix”. </p>

<p>Previously I was using the name “shpeacelover” which you can google about it.   </p>

<p>However I have not written much useful things under that name. </p>

<p>I hope since now on, I can be more focused on programming and technical things and write more delicately.   </p>

<p>Wish you all have a good time while visiting my dream land!</p>
