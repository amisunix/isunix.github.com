Of course you can google about it, but I just keep it down so that every time I do it, I do not need to google again. It is pretty easy. 

```html
{\% img [class names] /path/to/image [width] [height] [title text [alt text]] \%}
```
   
Of course you need to remove the "\\" in the above line. I just it there so it will be interpreted as inserting a pic here. Sorry about this.
   
Just add your pics in the above format. Note here I add a subdir in the source/images/ dir.  

That is it.
