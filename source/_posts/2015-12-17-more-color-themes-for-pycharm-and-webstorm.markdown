We can follow the link below to get more color themes for pycharm and webstorm.

```html
https://github.com/d1ffuz0r/pycharm-themes
```

Basically, For macos, it is:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/d1ffuz0r/pycharm-themes.git
cd pycharm-themes/colors
cp *.icls ~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm50/colors
```

For linux it is:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/d1ffuz0r/pycharm-themes.git
cd pycharm-themes/colors
cp *.icls ~/.PyCharm50/config/colors/
```

I have tested this on macos and it works.
