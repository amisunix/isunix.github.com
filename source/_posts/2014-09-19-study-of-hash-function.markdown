Recently I come across an algorithm, and I am sure I have no idea what it is doing, when I ask my colleague, he said it is hash algorithm.  Thus comes out this article talking about hash algorithms.  

First I will list some of the sites I visited while I am learning what is hash function, how to create it and how to use it.

I did not spend any time on this post yet.

This is said to be a very good article on hash function.

This is also a very good article.

and difinitely http://www.benfrederickson.com/ is a very good site for learning some knowledge of algorithms.

this post gives a very clear explanation of what hash function is
