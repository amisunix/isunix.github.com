For more on extending Perl with C, refer to the following tutorial. 

```
perlxs  
ExtUtils::ParseXS   
h2xs   
perlxstut  
```  

We can alse refer to these book, 

```   
extending and embedding perl    
Programming the Perl DBI   
Data Munging with Perl  
Vincent Pit's "XS Recipes"
```  

I like Perl and I also hope to use C to make somethings.   

Combining C and Perl together is a wonderful thing for me to try.  

Working on it.
