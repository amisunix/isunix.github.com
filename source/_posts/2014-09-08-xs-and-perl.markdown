For more on extending Perl with C, refer to the following tutorial. 

```
perlxs  
ExtUtils::ParseXS     
perlembed
h2xs   
perlxstut    
perlcall   
perlguts   
perlapi   
perlintern    
perlreguts  
perlreapi     
illguts : http://search.cpan.org/dist/illguts/   
http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/ext/XS/Typemap/Typemap.xs  

``` 

We can also refer to these books, 

```   
extending and embedding perl    
Programming the Perl DBI   
Data Munging with Perl  
Vincent Pit's "XS Recipes"
```  

I like Perl and I also hope to use C to make somethings.   

Combining C and Perl together is a wonderful thing for me to try.  

Working on it.
