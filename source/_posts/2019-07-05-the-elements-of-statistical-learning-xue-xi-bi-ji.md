# 0. Preface

        1. In God we trust, all others bring data

        2. We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

        3. There is no true interpretation of anything; interpretation is a vehicle in the service of human comprehension. The value of interpretation is in enabling others to fruitfully think about an idea.

        4. The quiet statisticians have changed our world; not by discov- ering new facts or technical developments, but by changing the ways that we reason, experiment and form our opinions
