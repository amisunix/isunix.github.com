I come across this tool through one of my colleagues. And I fell in love with it very soon. Here below are the steps I am using to set up the installation.  

The link for oddmuse is:  

```html
http://oddmuse.org/
```

For MacOS user, the link is:  

```html
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/oddmuse/oddmuse-1.806.dmg
```

This installation process is very trivial. I will write more about how to use oddmuse later.
