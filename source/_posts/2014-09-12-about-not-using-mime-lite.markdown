when you use "perldoc MIME::Lite", you will see the folliwng info:  

```
MIME::Lite is not recommended by its current maintainer.  There are a number of alternatives, like Email::MIME or MIME::Entity and Email::Sender, which you should probably use instead.  MIME::Lite continues to accrue weird bug reports, and it is not receiving a large amount of refactoring due to the availability of better alternatives. Please consider using something else.
```

Thus I decided not use MIME::Lite any more.
