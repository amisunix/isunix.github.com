I am going to write a series of notes regarding "natural language processing with python". The first article will be about the preface of the book.  

The following are the tool that are listed to be installed for this book, some are necessary and some are optional.  

1. NLTK

2. NLTK-Data  

3. NumPy (recommended) 

4. Matplotlib (recommended)  

5. NetworkX (optional)
