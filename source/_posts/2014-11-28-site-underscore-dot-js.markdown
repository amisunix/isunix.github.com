Of course we can download js files to our local directory and site the path of the jquery file and underscore file. We show how to use the online way here:  

```html
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.5.2/underscore-min.js"></script>
```

If you want a specific version of the jquery or underscore.js file, you can just go to the links listed above and find it by yourself.
