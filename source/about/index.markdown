Hi, This is Steven Sun. My Chinese name is 孙广新。I am an engineer in Sonata, an IT company in China.

I use this blog to keep notes of those things I consider important to me while I was learning something new.

The first company I have joined is "Merkle INC", in Chinese "美库尔商务信息咨询有限公司", from 2011/05 ~ 2012/07.
I am a database production analyst there. I acquired the basic knowledge of SQL, perl, shell script and developed my interest in programming there.

I won the "one team" award in Merkle, which is given to employees who do contribute to their team.

The current company I am in is "Sonata", in Chinese "自协软件"， from 2012/10 ~ now. I am a threat operations analyst here. I am using perl Regex to write regular expression. I am also using PHP to develop internal web tools and using perl to develop handy perl scripts and using Perl Dancer web frame work to develop web tools to aid my work on writing rules against spam message.

I majored in Computer science and Math when I was in university.

I am interested in math and joined the math competion(although did not get any good result) when I was in college.

I scored 649 in CET-4 and 585 in CET-6.

I am the number one student for three semesters among those non-English major students.

I am a MacOS and Ubuntu user.

As a summary I am interested in C, Perl, PHP, Python, Shell script, Bootstrap, jQuery, Machine Learning, C, Java. I am also learning Objective-c now.
